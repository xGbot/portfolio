Designed and implemented a mobile marketplace application using Android Studio and Java, integrating several key features to enhance its functionality and user experience. I implemented Google Maps API integration to display seller locations on a map, which facilitated easier navigation for users. Additionally, I integrated Firebase Authentication to ensure secure user logins, enhancing data privacy and authentication. I also designed and implemented the database structure to efficiently store and retrieve user and product information, optimizing the application's performance. Throughout the development process, I collaborated effectively with team members using GitHub, ensuring seamless code collaboration and version control.
